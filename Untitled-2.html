                    There were two things that were important to Tracey.
                     The first was her dog. Anyone that had ever met Tracey knew how much she loved her dog. 
                     Most would say that she treated it as her child. 
                     The dog went everywhere with her and it had been her best friend for the past five years. 
                     The second thing that was important to Tracey, however, would be a lot more surprising to most people.
